# OCC---Blossom
Implementation of the Blossom algorithm's in the Convex and Combinatorial Optimization Courses of the ENS.

Implementation of the Edmond's blossom algoritm. Using Union-and-Find, we can go to $\mathcal{O}(mn\log(n))$ time. A succinct description of such implementation can be found in the book "combinatorial optimization" by Cook, Cunningham, Pulleyblank and Schrijver (pages 140-141).

In this project we implement the above algoritm.
